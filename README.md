# Tableau-AirBnB-Listings-Seattle-2016


In this project I worked with an open source dataset from Kaggle which included a trove of information about AirBnB listings in the Seattla, WA. area. The Tableau report
showcases interesting information such as the most expensive zipcodes, the amount of listings by amount of bedrooms, total revenue by amount of bedrooms,
average price per bedroom and a line graph showing revenue evolution throughout the year of 2016.

The visualization presents the data in a clean and easy to read report. While an individual or firm interested in investing in a unit for rental purposes in the area
might gain useful information from the report, they will also undoubtedly have new questions to ask after looking it over.

With a dataset of this size a skilled data analyst could dive deeper to answer further questions,
therefore this visualization surves the purpose of initial data exploration.
